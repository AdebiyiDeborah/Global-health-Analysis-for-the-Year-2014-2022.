🌍 Global Health Analysis Dashboard
📌 Introduction

In today’s interconnected world, global health is a pressing concern that affects us all. From pandemics to healthcare disparities, understanding the complexities of global health is crucial for building a healthier future.

This project explores the latest trends, challenges, and insights shaping the global health landscape. Through data analysis and visualization, I uncover key patterns and stories behind global health metrics.

🎯 Problem Statement

Despite significant advancements in medical technology and connectivity, millions of people still lack access to quality healthcare, resulting in:

Widespread health disparities

Marginalized communities suffering poorer health outcomes

Escalating healthcare costs threatening global economic stability

As a data analyst, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset and developed a dashboard to reveal insights that can help drive positive changes in global health.

📊 Pre-Analysis Questions

Potential analytical questions included:

What are the top three years with the highest sanitary expenses?

Which countries have the highest infant death and fertility rates?

What are the top ten countries with low immunization?

What is the sum of GDP per capita from 2012–2019?

How does suicide rate (%) relate to alcohol consumption from 2014–2019?

What is the female population in the top ten countries?

🧠 Pre-Analysis Insights

- High sanitary expenses may indicate environmental or public health challenges.

- Countries with high infant death & fertility rates require deeper investigation.

- Low immunization rates often correlate with poor hygiene and sanitation.

- GDP per capita trends help reveal population work pressure and economic strain.

📌 Analysis
🔍 Key Observations
- Top Three Years by Sanitary Expenses; 2021: $1,350.93, 2020: $1,338.01, 2019: $1,212.56

- Top Ten Countries with Low Immunization; Liechtenstein: 0 immunization; South Sudan: 552, Nigeria: 529

- Sum of GDP Per Capita (2012–2019); Major decline from $3,069,459.31 in 2014, Dropped to $2,710,643.20 in 2015, 2012 started at $2,926,358.72

- Countries with Highest Infant Death & Fertility
Country	Infant Death (Sum)	Fertility Rate (Sum), India	8,398,815	22,307, Nigeria	5,607,401	55,329, Pakistan	3,753,550	38.1

🧩 Pre-Insights

- 2021 sanitary expenses deserve deeper investigation to identify major cost drivers.

- Liechtenstein urgently needs improved immunization programs.

- High fertility + high infant death countries require maternal and child health interventions.

- The GDP drop (2014 → 2015) suggests economic instability that should be investigated.

📌 Post-Analysis
📈 Additional Observations

- 2021: $1,350,929,259 sanitary expenses; $3,293,123,509 GDP per capita

- Brazil (2013): $1,225,856,575 GDP; 855 low immunization

- Austria: 896 low immunization; 2,487 infant deaths; 1,473 fertility rate

✔️ Recommendations

- Increase sanitation campaigns to match rising sanitary expenses.

- Review Brazil’s tax laws, investment flow, and trade policies affecting GDP.

- Promote newborn care practices (breastfeeding, hygienic cord care, thermal protection).

- Improve female education and empowerment—key to reducing infant mortality.
